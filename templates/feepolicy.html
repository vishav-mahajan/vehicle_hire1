            <b>Note: Payments owed by members will be deducted from the security deposit. If the security deposit does not cover such payments, the balance must be paid by the member electronically.
            </b><br><br>
<b>*</b>Please note there are four cases where there will be exceptions:<br><br>

<br>In the event the member is found to be under the influence of alcohol during a booking, the member will be held liable for 100% of the vehicle damage bill as per the invoice received from the vehicle workshop.<br>

<br>The member will be liable for 100% of the entire vehicle damage bill in the event that the vehicle workshop and/or insurance company deem the damage to be consequential in nature (this will be clearly stated in the accident report).<br>
            Consequential damage occurs when the member continues driving even after an external vehicle impact, thereby severely undermining the condition of the vehicle.
<br>In the event a non-Adrenture member is found to be the one driving at the time of accident, then the member will be held liable for 100% of the vehicle damage bill as per the invoice received from the workshop.<br>
<br>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, only SUV vehicles are permitted for trips to regions having higher altitudes including but not limited to Leh or Ladakh districts in Jammu & Kashmir. Damages caused to the vehicles except falling under SUV (Ecosport, Scorpio, XUV, Tata Safari, Toyota Fortuner) category will attract charges viz; damages fees of ₹ 10,000 along with repairs cost, towing cost, travel cost of representatives of Adrenture and other related charges, if any on actual basis.<br><br>


<b>Member's Responsibility</b><br>
If a Adrenture member is violating the law or Adrenture rules, for example by overspeeding or driving drunk, the member will be responsible for all damage, liability, and fines and could face legal action.

Member is solely responsible for any associated bank or credit card charges or fees. Member may be charged a processing fee for a declined credit or debit card payment.<br><br>
In the event the Member defaults on any payments, Adrenture is entitled to charge reminder fees and default interest in accordance with the provisions of the law. In addition, Adrenture may utilize third parties to collect amounts owed to Adrenture by a Member.<br><br>
With all fees mentioned above, Adrenture reserves the right to prohibit a Member from making a subsequent reservation until all outstanding fees in the Member's account have been paid in full. In the event a fee is incurred, Members will receive an email invoice from Adrenture that will have detailed payment instructions.<br><br>
            <b>Collision or other incident:</b><br><br>
Adrenture provides full wrap unlimited third party liability insurance without a maximum cap.<br><br>
If member is involved in an unintentional/non consequential incident/accident (including but not limited to a collision or misuse of the vehicle) Member will be responsible for a standard insurance deductible payment of up to ₹ 10,000. The Member will be obligated to pay the repair cost up to ₹ 10000. The payment owed will be deducted from the security deposit, if any. Should the security deposit not cover the payment (in the case the Member has accrued late return, excess km, etc charges) the balance of the payment owed shall be payable by the Member separately as an additional outstanding.
<br><br>Member will be responsible for all towing and impounding charges associated with a collision.
<br><br>Member will be responsible for all towing and impounding charges caused by member failure.
<br><br>Adrenture will be responsible for all towing and impounding charges caused by vehicle failure.

            <br><br>
<b>Tolls:</b><br><br>

<br><br>Adrenture vehicles are registered with an All India Permit, allowing the vehicle to enter any state in the country.
<br><br>Members must pay all inter-state taxes and fees upon entering into a neighbouring state.
<br><br><i>Adrenture reserves the right to change the terms of this Policy from time to time and shall give notice of such changes to the Member in a timely manner.
